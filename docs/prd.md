# Tic Tac Toe React Frontend – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview and Goals
This document defines the product requirements for a simple Tic Tac Toe web application built in React 18 using Create React App. The app enables two local players to play on the same device, alternating turns on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw. The goals are to provide a minimal, responsive, accessible, and reliable gameplay experience, ensure code quality through tests and linting, and align with adapted GxP compliance considerations for a UI-only application.

Primary objectives:
- Deliver a clean, modern “Ocean Professional” themed UI.
- Implement robust local game logic with clear status messaging.
- Provide a small, maintainable codebase with unit (>80%) and basic integration tests aligned to gameplay.
- Document validation and compliance rationale appropriate for a UI-only, no-backend scope.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
1. US-001: Start a new game
   - As a player, I want to start a new game so that the board is empty and X moves first.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - On loading the app or pressing “New Game”, the board contains 9 empty cells.
     - The status shows “Next: X”.
     - Implementation: App renders empty squares; “New Game” resets state.
     - Tests: App.test.js verifies initial state and reset behavior.

2. US-002: Alternate turns
   - As players, we want the game to alternate between X and O turns.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Clicking an empty cell on X’s turn places “X”, then status updates to “Next: O”.
     - Clicking an empty cell on O’s turn places “O”, then status updates to “Next: X”.
     - A filled or disabled cell cannot be clicked to change its value.
     - Tests: App.test.js validates first move and subsequent status updates.

3. US-003: Win detection
   - As players, we want the game to detect a winner and prevent further moves.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - When a player has three in a row (row, column, or diagonal), the status shows “Winner: X” or “Winner: O” and the board becomes disabled.
     - Tests: App.test.js simulates a winning sequence and expects “Winner: X”.

4. US-004: Draw detection
   - As players, we want the game to detect a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - When the board is full and no winner exists, show “Draw” and prevent additional moves.
     - Tests: App.test.js drives a draw and expects “Draw”.

5. US-005: Accessibility basics
   - As any user, I want the game to be operable and understandable with basic accessibility affordances.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Status has role="status" with aria-live="polite".
     - Board has role="grid"; cells are buttons with descriptive accessible names (e.g., “Cell 1 empty”).
     - Keyboard operation through button semantics works.
     - Visual focus is visible via default browser focus ring or OS settings.

## Non-functional Requirements (Performance, Accessibility, Security)
- Performance:
  - The app should load and render within 2 seconds on a typical broadband connection for first paint under CRA defaults.
  - State transitions and re-renders should be instantaneously responsive (<50ms under normal conditions).
- Accessibility:
  - Provide semantic roles (grid, button, status).
  - Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA for primary UI text using the Ocean Professional theme.
  - Maintain focus behavior for interactive elements and avoid keyboard traps.
- Security:
  - No external data, no authentication, no storage of personal data.
  - Scope rationale: As a local, UI-only app without backend services, typical app-level security controls such as RBAC and API authorization are not applicable. ESLint is configured to reduce code quality issues that can lead to vulnerabilities.
- Maintainability:
  - Code is organized by component with PropTypes on public components (Board, Square).
  - ESLint rules enforce no-unused-vars and React best practices.
- Browser Support:
  - As per CRA defaults and browserslist in package.json.

## GxP Compliance Considerations (scope/rationale for a UI-only app)
- Data Integrity and Audit Trails:
  - No persistent data is created or maintained; all state is transient in-memory UI state. Therefore, full ALCOA+ audit trail is out-of-scope. The rationale is documented and accepted given no data storage, no user identity, and no regulated records generated.
- Electronic Signatures and Access Controls:
  - Not applicable for local two-player gameplay without identities, authentication, or persistence. This is explicitly documented as out-of-scope.
- Validation:
  - Validation focuses on functional correctness of gameplay, UI accessibility, and predictable behavior. Validation evidence is provided via automated unit and integration tests with traceability to requirements.
- Error Handling:
  - The UI handles invalid interactions (e.g., clicking filled squares or after game end) gracefully by ignoring events. No backend/network failures exist in scope.

## Release Criteria and KPIs
Release Criteria:
- Functional:
  - All user stories and acceptance criteria satisfied.
  - Accurate win and draw detection across all lines.
  - New Game reliably resets state and status.
- Quality:
  - Unit test coverage ≥ 80% for src/.
  - Integration tests pass (UI interactions in App.test.js).
  - ESLint passes with no errors.
- Accessibility:
  - Status and controls have semantic roles; basic keyboard operation validated.
- Compliance Documentation:
  - PRD and Architecture docs complete, including validation scope, GxP rationale, and traceability.

KPIs:
- Test coverage percentage ≥ 80%.
- Lint errors = 0.
- Functional test pass rate = 100%.
- Page load acceptable for CRA baseline (informational KPI).

## Risks and Assumptions
- Risks:
  - Overextending GxP controls beyond scope may introduce unnecessary complexity. Documented rationale contains and mitigates this.
  - Visual regressions could degrade accessibility; mitigated by minimal, stable CSS and CRA defaults.
- Assumptions:
  - No backend, no persistence, no user identification.
  - Two-player, same-device mode only.
  - CRA defaults for build and environment are acceptable.

## Out of Scope
- Multiplayer over network, matchmaking, or remote play.
- User accounts, authentication, access control, or roles.
- Persistent storage of game state or audit logs.
- Electronic signatures, 21 CFR Part 11 features.
- Internationalization beyond English labels.

## Test Plan Summary
- Unit Tests:
  - Core state transitions, calculateWinner behavior, status messaging, and reset logic.
  - Coverage goal ≥ 80%.
- Integration Tests:
  - UI interactions through Testing Library simulating clicks for gameplay sequences (win, draw, restart).
- Validation Tests:
  - Functional validation of acceptance criteria (US-001 to US-004).
  - Basic accessibility validation: presence of roles, aria-live on status, and button semantics.
- Tooling:
  - Jest and @testing-library/react via CRA.
  - ESLint for static quality checks.

## Traceability Matrix (Requirements → Implementation → Tests)
- US-001 Start game → App.js (state init, handleRestart) → App.test.js (“shows initial status...”, “click 'New Game' resets...”)
- US-002 Alternate turns → App.js (handleSquareClick, status logic), Board.jsx, Square.jsx → App.test.js (first move and status update)
- US-003 Win detection → App.js (calculateWinner, disabled flag, status) → App.test.js (“simulates a win for X...”)
- US-004 Draw detection → App.js (draw calc via useMemo, disabled flag) → App.test.js (“simulates a draw...”)
- US-005 Accessibility → App.js (role="status", aria-live="polite"), Board.jsx (role="grid"), Square.jsx (buttons with labels) → Covered by manual review and implicit Testing Library queries

## Release Gate Checklist
- Functional stories US-001 to US-004 pass in tests.
- Basic accessibility checks pass (roles, aria-live, keyboard operation).
- Unit coverage ≥ 80%, integration tests pass.
- ESLint passes with no errors.
- PRD and Architecture documents updated and reviewed.
